# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Projects

Notebooks, Datasets and Code for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects

There are 3 main projects covering data [investigation](/Project_1_Investigate_A_Dataset), [wrangling](/Project_2_Data_Wrangling), and [visualisation](/Project_3_Data_Visualisation) respectively. 

## Project 1
Here, I analysed data containing information about 100,000 patient appointments in Brazil with a view to identifying what factors were most important in predicting whether a patient showed up for the appointment or not.

## Project 2
I gathered and used data from various sources including the Twitter API, performed cleaning tasks and provided insights on tweets from the WeRateDogs Archive.

## Project 3
I analysed the Prosper Loans Dataset and generated visualisations depicting distribution of singular variables and bivariate and multivariate relationships between variables.
